# AP CS A Optimisation Activity

This simple application reads data from a CSV file and performs simple analysis on it.

There are many inefficiencies in this application, which can be resolved using hoisting,
lazy evaluation/memoisation and other techniques.


## Utilities

* The `Pair` class provides a 2-tuple generic class.
* The `Lazy` class provides a wrapper for lazily evaluated/memoised computations.
